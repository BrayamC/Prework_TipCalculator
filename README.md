## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

One of the challenges I faced, was trying to keep track of data across screens. For example, I had trouble knowing when the user clicked on dark/light mode in the settings screen. I fixed this problem with user default values. Because this was my first time using mac software, I had to take some time to adjust to different shortcuts.
